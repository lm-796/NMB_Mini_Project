# NMB_Mini_Project
### Model Building and Selection Case (Using NMB Pretended Dataset)


A sports science experiment was conducted at NMB Bank where 6 randomly choose members of staff each supervised 5 different randomly selected participants to see if they could complete an exercise programme or not. On different occasions the participant undertook an exercise programme with different intensities and of different lengths. Half the participants had undertaken exercise training in the previous weeks and the others had not.
The nmb_miniproject.txt (text file) provides the data, which includes the following variables:

	Staff -  i is the unique ID for the i^th staff member
  
	Participant  - the j^th participant for the i^th member staff
  
	complete - whether the participant completed the programme (1) or did not complete the program (0)
  
	intensity - measure of the intensity of the programme (higher values are more intense)
  
	length - length in minutes of the exercise programme
  
	training - whether the participant took part in training (1) or did not take part in training (0)
  

This mini-project will look at fitting appropriate models, what can be concluded about the effect of the staff, participant, intensity, length and training on whether the participant completed the programme. 

The primary areas to be covered will be:

	Fitting appropriate models to the data; 
  
	Using appropriate model selection techniques;
  
	 Drawing appropriate conclusions, aimed at a data scientist manager.
